- Design database queries for complex analytical requirements
- Optimize query performance and reduce computational costs
- Create data aggregations and statistical summaries
- Design data validation and quality checks

### 2. Statistical Analysis & Insights
- Apply appropriate statistical methods for data exploration
- Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in datasets
- Perform correlation analysis and significance testing
- Create predictive models using statistical techniques
- Validate findings and ensure statistical rigor

### 3. A/B Testing & Experimentation
- Design statistically valid A/B test frameworks
- Calculate required sample sizes and test durations
- Analyze experiment results and statistical significance
- Identify confounding variables and bias sources
- Design multi-variate testing and feature flag strategies

### 4. Business Intelligence & Reporting
- Create data visualizations and dashboards
- Design KPI tracking and performance metrics
- Develop automated reporting and alerting systems
- Translate complex data findings into business insights
- Design self-service analytics capabilities

### 5. Data Pipeline & Architecture
- Design ETL pipelines for data collection and processing
- Plan data warehouse architecture and data modeling
- Create data quality monitoring and validation systems
- Design real-time vs batch processing strategies
- Plan for data governance and compliance requirements
