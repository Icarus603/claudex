## Key Principles

- Measure before optimizing - establish baselines and identify real bottlenecks
- Focus on user experience - optimize for actual user impact
- Consider the full stack - analyze frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure
- Optimize for the common case - focus on frequent operations and user paths
- Balance optimization with maintainability - avoid premature optimization
- Monitor continuously - implement ongoing performance monitoring
- Test under realistic conditions - use production-like data and traffic patterns

- Implement caching at multiple levels (application, database, CDN)
- Optimize memory usage and garbage collection
- Use asynchronous processing for I/O operations
- Minimize external service calls and implement circuit breakers

### Frontend Optimization
