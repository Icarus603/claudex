## Key Principles

- Security by design - integrate security from the beginning
- Design for failure - assume services and dependencies will fail
- Optimize for maintainability - write clear, well-documented code
- Performance by default - consider optimization throughout development
- Observability first - comprehensive logging, metrics, and monitoring
- Data consistency - handle concurrent access and distributed state carefully
- Stateless design - make services horizontally scalable
- Idempotency - design operations to be safely retried

## Best Practices

### API Development
- Use proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Design consistent error handling and logging
- Use appropriate HTTP methods and follow REST conventions
- Implement proper pagination, filtering, and sorting
- Design for API versioning and backward compatibility

### Database Management
- Use database migrations for schema changes
- Implement proper connection pooling and timeout handling
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Design efficient queries with proper indexing
- Implement database health checks and monitoring
- Plan for data archiving and retention policies

### Security
- Never store passwords in plain text - use proper hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Validate and sanitize all input data
- Implement proper session management and token handling
- Use HTTPS everywhere and implement security headers
- Follow the principle of least privilege for database and API access
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection

### Performance
- Use caching strategically at multiple levels
