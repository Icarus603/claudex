$THINKING_LEVEL about implementation approach.

## Intelligent Implementation Workflow

Target: $ARGUMENTS (or next logical component if not specified)

**Steps to execute:**

1. **Context Analysis & Planning with Error Recovery**
   - Read `SPECS.md` to understand what needs to be built
   - **SPECS.md Error Handling:**
     - If `SPECS.md` is missing: Create basic implementation plan from `PRD.md`
     - If incomplete: Use available sections and flag missing areas
     - If corrupted: Request regeneration via `/design` command
   - Analyze existing codebase for patterns and structure
   - Determine target component and its requirements
   - Set appropriate thinking level based on complexity
   - **Fallback Planning:**
     - If no clear next component: Implement foundation layers first
     - If dependencies unclear: Build independent components in parallel

2. **Capability Assessment**
   - Analyze what the component requires
   - Determine what Claude can build directly vs. what needs specialists

3. **Agent Selection Strategy**

   **Claude Handles Directly (90% of cases):**
   ```
   âœ… CLI tools and command-line applications
   âœ… REST APIs and CRUD services
   âœ… Next.js/SvelteKit/Remix full-stack apps
   âœ… Database operations and schema design
   âœ… File operations and data processing
   âœ… Authentication and authorization (standard patterns)
   âœ… Basic web UI with standard interactions
   âœ… Configuration management and logging
   âœ… Testing and error handling
   âœ… Standard business logic and workflows
   ```

4. **Implementation Planning**
   - Enter plan mode and present your technical implementation strategy based on the above analysis:
     - Specific components to build and their implementation order
     - Technical approach and patterns to use
     - Dependencies and integration points
     - Testing strategy and validation approach
     - Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

5. **Implementation Execution with Coordination Patterns**

   **Pattern A: Claude Direct (90% of cases)**
   - Claude builds complete component
   - Updates `SPECS.md` with completion

   **Pattern B: Sequential Specialist Chain**
   - Used when specialists have dependencies
   - Example: CLI Agent Tool
     1. ai-ml-engineer implements AI core â†’ returns interfaces
     2. **qa-engineer validates** AI integration patterns and error handling
     3. backend-engineer integrates AI with CLI â†’ uses interfaces  
     4. **qa-engineer validates** distributed system reliability and performance
     5. Claude integrates final implementation
     6. **qa-engineer performs** end-to-end validation

   **Pattern C: Parallel Specialist Coordination**
   - Used when specialists work independently
   - Example: Web App with AI Features
     1. **SIMULTANEOUSLY:**
        - frontend-engineer builds UI components
        - ai-ml-engineer builds AI backend services
        - **qa-engineer validates** interface contracts and integration compatibility
     2. Claude integrates all components using validated interfaces
     3. **qa-engineer performs** final integration testing

   **Pattern D: Layered Implementation**
   - Used for complex systems with clear layers
   - Example: Data Pipeline with ML
     1. Layer 1: backend-engineer (data ingestion)
     2. **qa-engineer validates** layer functionality and interface contracts
     3. Layer 2: data-scientist (transformation logic) 
     4. **qa-engineer validates** data quality and processing accuracy
     5. Layer 3: ai-ml-engineer (ML processing)
     6. **qa-engineer validates** ML model integration and performance
     7. Claude integrates layers sequentially with validated foundations

6. **Feedback Loop Detection During Implementation**

   **Architecture Insufficiency Detection:**
   - **Component complexity exceeds specifications:**
     - Implementation reveals missing architectural details
     - Interface contracts are incomplete or contradictory
     - Performance requirements cannot be met with current design
     - **Feedback Action:** Flag need to return to `/design` with specific architectural gaps
   
   - **Requirements Ambiguity During Implementation:**
     - Business logic unclear from requirements
     - User stories insufficient for implementation decisions
     - Acceptance criteria missing or contradictory
     - **Feedback Action:** Flag need to return to `/discover` with specific requirement clarifications
   
   - **Technology Stack Issues:**
     - Chosen technologies insufficient for requirements
     - Integration complexity higher than anticipated
     - Performance characteristics don't match needs
     - **Feedback Action:** Flag need for `/design` technology re-evaluation
   
   **Implementation Feedback Triggers:**
   - Agent failure patterns indicating missing context
   - Repeated implementation attempts failing on same components
   - Test failures revealing fundamental design issues
   - Integration problems between components

7. **Error Recovery & Fallback Strategies**
   
   **Specialist Agent Failures:**
   - **Single specialist fails**: Claude implements with basic patterns + documents limitations
   - **Multiple specialists fail**: Escalate to Claude direct implementation
   - **Partial responses**: Request specific missing sections or proceed with available code
   
   **Implementation Failures:**
   - **Code doesn't integrate**: Analyze interface mismatches and create adapters
   - **Performance issues**: Fall back to simpler implementations
   - **Dependency conflicts**: Use version pinning or alternative libraries
   
   **Quality Assurance Failures:**
   - **QA agent fails**: Claude performs basic testing validation
   - **Tests fail**: Implement fixes or document known issues for future resolution
   - **Integration issues**: Create temporary workarounds with TODO items
   
   **Progressive Degradation:**
   - **High complexity**: Try "think harder" â†’ "think hard" â†’ "think" â†’ direct implementation
   - **Resource constraints**: Simplify scope to core functionality
   - **Time pressure**: Implement MVP version with enhancement TODOs

## Continuous Quality Assurance Strategy

**QA Integration During Implementation:**

**Pattern A: Claude Direct** â†’ QA validation after implementation for:
- Critical system components
- User-facing features  
- Security-sensitive implementations
- Components with external dependencies

**Pattern B: Sequential Specialist Chain** â†’ QA validation between each specialist:
- After ai-ml-engineer: Validate AI integration patterns and error handling
- After backend-engineer: Validate distributed system reliability and performance
- After final integration: End-to-end QA validation

**Pattern C: Parallel Specialist Coordination** â†’ QA coordination during parallel work:
- **SIMULTANEOUSLY** call qa-engineer with specialists to:
  - Validate interface contracts as they're implemented
  - Ensure integration compatibility between parallel components
  - Test component interactions in real-time

**Pattern D: Layered Implementation** â†’ QA gates between layers:
- After each layer: Validate layer functionality and interface contracts
- Before next layer: Ensure stable foundation for dependent components
- Final integration: Complete system validation

**Claude handles QA directly for:**
- Standard CRUD operations
- Simple CLI tools without external integrations
- Basic web interfaces with standard patterns
- Standard business logic without complex dependencies

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Build (Most Common)
```
Claude analyzes â†’ Claude implements â†’ Update SPECS.md
```

### Pattern 2: Expert Consultation
```
Claude analyzes â†’ Claude builds foundation â†’ 
Specialist adds expertise â†’ Claude integrates â†’ QA if needed
```

### Pattern 3: Specialist-Led (Rare)
```
Claude analyzes â†’ Route to specialist â†’ 
Specialist implements â†’ QA validates â†’ Update SPECS.md
```
